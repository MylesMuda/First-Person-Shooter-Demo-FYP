# First-Person-Shooter-Demo-FYP
A first person shooter made for my final year project using C# scripts.

*Open source assets were used for the animations and models in the project.* 
All game logic is handled by C# scripts made by myself. These can be viewed in the **"Scripts"** folder in the root of the repository.

## Screenshots of the game
